# Tsunami Experiments with the Multi-Layer Shallow Water Equations

Simple test cases to see if a layered approach to tsunami modeling might have
some advantages (or disadvantages).  These scripts are based off of work done in
[1].  Note that the multilayer package at 

http://github.com/mandli/multilayer-examples/tree/master/1d/multilayer

is needed to run this code.  Either use a symbolic link to make it local or
simply copy the package to this local directory.
